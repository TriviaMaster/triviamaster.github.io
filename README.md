# TriviaMaster
A temporary site to show TriviaMaster V3's upcoming features. [Join the Discord!](https://discord.gg/p6MAC99)

## What is TriviaMaster?
TriviaMaster started off as a Discord bot. It still is, but in Version 3, users can expect to see some drastic improvements: more cool commands such as team-based trivia duels, faster response times, user profiles, a shop, and achievements! I also plan to add a website for TriviaMaster with a bunch of features as well as a TriviaMaster mobile app. There are a lot of things to be excited about in V3, and I hope that these new additions will make it worth the long, long wait.

## FAQ
### Why did you take it down?
Due to scalability issues, the bot began to start having errors once it started reaching a large number of guilds. Due to these errors, it would keep crashing and attempting to restart, spamming the Discord API with login requests. In the fear that Discord would disable my bot indefinitely if this continued, I took it down so I could fix it up and add some new features while I was at it.

### When will you finish?
Recently, I've been drowning in schoolwork, university applications, and part-time jobs. However, I'll be done with all of that this summer, so expect V3 to be completed sometime at the end of August 2020!

Please note that some of the bigger new features may most likely be gradually rolled out after this date.
